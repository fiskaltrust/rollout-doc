### In which cases is a notification mandatory?
- initial commissioning of the Cashregister: If the fiskaltrust.Middleware is used then this reflects the initial-operation-receipt
- decommissioning of the Cashregister: If the fiskaltrust.Middleware is used then this reflects the out-of-operation-receipt

#### Whenever the mandatory data of the last notification changed a new notification needs to be sent to update the data at the financial authorities
This includes...
- Changing the used TSE
- Changes in the mandatory master data

### Deadlines
A notification is mandatory within a month whenever an initial commissioning, decommissioning, or update/correction of the previous notification occurs.

#### For the start of the notifications in 2025 a transitional period was introduced:
- Cashregisters commissioned before July 1st 2025 need to be included in the notification by July 31st 2025
- Cashregisters decommissioned before July 1st 2025 only need to be included in the notification if this Cashregister has been part of a notification before _fiskaltrust won't notify about Cashregisters before July 1st 2025_
- Cashregisters commissioned on/after July 1st 2025 need to be included in the notification within a month

## Technical Background
_Please note that the following information may be subject to change in the future._

All cash registers at an outlet must be included in the notification. For those using the fiskaltrust.Middleware, we already have most of the necessary information. Cash registers not using the fiskaltrust.Middleware can still be added to the fiskaltrust.Notification through various user-friendly methods. Fiskaltrust will generate the notification and use the ERiC interface to submit the notification to ELSTER.

If we lack some data needed for an outlet's notification, we have a straightforward automated process in place that will prompt the POS operator to provide the missing information.

### Prerequisites for POSDealers/Operators
Since we use data from the fiskaltrust.Middleware and fiskaltrust.Portal to generate the notification, certain master data values must be present in the POSOperator's account. As previously mentioned, the POS operator will be prompted to provide any missing information before we create the notification. However, the more of the following values that are already filled out, the less the POSOperator will need to fill out later.

| Source | Path | Value | Description |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| POSOperator-Account | Company info / Master Data | St-IdNr | The taxId (Steuernummer) is mandatory for the notification. Using the USt-IdNr is not possible. |
| POSOperator-Account | Company info / Master Data | Address | Streetname and Housenumber are mandatory.|
| POSOperator-Account | Company info / Master Data | Postal code | The postal code is mandatory.|
| POSOperator-Account | Company info / Master Data | City | The city is mandatory.|
| POSOperator-Account | Company info / Outlets | Address | Streetname and Housenumber are mandatory.|
| POSOperator-Account | Company info / Outlets | Postal code | The postal code is mandatory.|
| POSOperator-Account | Company info / Outlets | City | The city is mandatory.|

### Preriquities for POSCreators
The fiskaltrust.Notification product won't require a new implementation. However there are processes, receipts and data that have already been part of the fiskaltrust.Middleware that are now mandatory for the notification. 

#### Receipts
- Initial-Operation-Receipt
- Out-Of-Operation-Receipt
- Initiate-Switch-Receipt
- Finish-Switch-Receipt

#### PosSystemId
The PosSytemId has been mandatory since the beginning. We use the PosSystemId to map the masterdata of your POSSystem to the individual Middleware-Instances. POSSystem masterdata is a mandatory part of the notification.
