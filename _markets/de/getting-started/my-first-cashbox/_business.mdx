The *Business rollout* used in this tutorial will acquire entitlements, transfer them to the PosOperators outlets, activate them and eventually create necessary backend components for the CashBox (in this case, an SCU). 

For this setup, we choose a fiskaltrust.Carefree plan with a Swissbit TSE. The fiskaltrust.Carefree plan will create a Carefree and TSE-as-a-Service bundle and automatically generate and assign a Swissbit TSE to your account. Using an online TSE means no further hardware provisioning steps are required from your side. For a quick tutorial, we refrain from choosing a PosOperator and its outlets but assign the bundle to your account and outlet. 

To start the Business rollout, **log into your portal account** and proceed with the following steps.

import ReactPlayer from "react-player"

<ReactPlayer controls url={require("./media/business-rollout.mp4").default} /><br />

1. Open your the **rollout management page** from [`Rollout Management` / `Plan`](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.de/RolloutManagement/Plan) (*Sandbox link*) in the left-hand navigation menu.
2. Select `Business Rollout - Rolling out products`.
3. **Filter** for `swissbit cloud` and **limit entries** to `Dealerpackage based plans`.
4. Select the plan **4445-0008**. This plan will create **an SCU with a Swissbit Cloud TSE**.
5. Select `Perform the rollout for the current account`.
6. Tick the **desired outlet** where you would like to roll out the Middleware.
7. Click `Submit Selection`.
8. Click `Create quote` - *this will take a few seconds. Once the quote is ready, the button will change to `Load quote into basket`.*
9. Click `Load quote into basket` to **place the quote** into your basket.
10. Verify that the items in your basket match the selected products.
11. Click `Checkout`.
12. Click `binding order` to **complete the order**.

-----

At this point, should have the order listed under [`Shop` / `Orders`](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.de/Shop/Orders). Finishing the order can take a couple of minutes, but once it has been completed, there should be the following items active in your account

* two **new demo subscriptions** under [`Shop` / `Subscriptions`](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.de/Shop/Subscriptions)
* a **new SCU** for a Swissbit Cloud TSE under [`Configuration` / `Signature Creation Unit`](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.de/SignatureCreationUnitDE)

#### Review successful completion

Select `Company Name` / `Outlets`.
Filter the outlet table by entering a search term or sort the outlets by clicking on one of the table headings.
For example, in the `Carefree` and `AKO` columns, you can check whether these products are activated.
The following image shows an example of activating the fiskaltrust.CarefreeBundle for the selected location:

### Technical Rollout (generate the CashBox)

The second step is the *Technical* rollout which will use a [template](../technical-operations/rollout-automation/templates.md) to create a new CashBox and a new Queue. It will also link the previously created SCU (*from the Business rollout*) to the new Queue.

We choose a rollout plan based on a Swissbit template for this setup. This plan will create a new queue, a new CashBox, and link the previously created SCU.

To start the Technical rollout **log into your portal account** and proceed with the following steps.

<ReactPlayer controls url={require("./media/technical-rollout.mp4").default} /><br />

1. Open your the **rollout management page** from [`Rollout Management`](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.de/RolloutManagement/Plan) (*Sandbox link*) in the left-hand navigation menu.
2. Select `Technical Rollout - Creating cashboxes at scale`.
3. **Filter** for `fiskaltrust Middleware für Swissbit Cloud TSE`.
4. Select the plan `fiskaltrust Middleware für Swissbit Cloud TSE`.
5. Select `Perform the rollout for the current account`.
6. Tick the **same outlet** you chose before during the Business rollout.
7. Click `Submit Selection`.
8. Click `Create quote` - *this will take a few seconds. Once the quote is ready, the button will change to `Load quote into basket`.*
9. Click `Load quote into basket` to **place the quote** into your basket.
10. Verify that the items in your basket match the selected products.
11. Click `Checkout`.
12. Click `binding order` to **complete the order**.

At this point, should have the order listed under [`Shop` / `Orders`](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.de/Shop/Orders). Finishing the order can take a couple of minutes, but once it has been completed, you should have

* a **new queue** under [`Configuration` / `Queue`](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.de/Queue)
* a **new CashBox** under [`Configuration` / `CashBox`](https://portal-sandbox.fiskaltrust.de/CashBox)
