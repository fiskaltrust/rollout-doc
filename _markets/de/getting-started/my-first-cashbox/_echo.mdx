:::caution

This example uses REST as a communication protocol and requires your queue to have a configured `rest://` URL.

:::

To perform an "echo" request, you will need to send a `POST` request to the configured Middleware URL, with the path `/json/v1/Echo`. That request takes a JSON object in its request body, with one single string field named `Message`, containing the message string you'd like to receive back from the Middleware.

```JSON
{
    "Message": "Hello fiskaltrust.Middleware!"
}
```

The following HTTP request example would take the (minified) JSON object from above and send `Hello fiskaltrust.Middleware!` to the Middleware.

```http
POST /json/v1/Echo HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Length: 46
Content-Type: application/json

{ "Message": "Hello fiskaltrust.Middleware!" }
```

The response to your request should have a status code of 200 and contain the same object and the exact string you sent in the request in the response body.
