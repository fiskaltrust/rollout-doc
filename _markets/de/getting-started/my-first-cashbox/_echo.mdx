:::caution

This example uses REST as a communication protocol and requires your queue to have a configured `rest://` URL.

:::

To perform an "echo" request, you will need to send a `POST` request to the configured Middleware URL, with the path `/v1/Echo`.

You can get the middleware URL from the portal cashbox configuration page.
![](./media/cloudcashbox-url.png)

That request takes a JSON object in its request body, with one single string field named `Message`, containing the message string you'd like to receive back from the Middleware.

```JSON
{
    "Message": "Hello fiskaltrust.Middleware!"
}
```

:::info

For the cloudcashbox you need to provide the `cashboxid` and `accesstoken` headers in the request.
You can also get them from the cashbox configuration page.

:::

The following HTTP request example would take the (minified) JSON object from above and send `Hello fiskaltrust.Middleware!` to a CloudCashbox.

```http
POST  https://cloudcashbox-sandbox.fiskaltrust.de/v1/Echo HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Length: 46
Content-Type: application/json
cashboxid: XXXX
accesstoken: XXXX

{ "Message": "Hello fiskaltrust.Middleware!" }
```

The response to your request should have a status code of 200 and contain the same object and the exact string you sent in the request in the response body.

:::info

You can find the full details on the request and its parameters (along with a curl example) [here](https://middleware-samples.docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/#11f73789-cf7d-4510-bf2c-d3698e954dac).
