## Introduction

In addition to the license-free fiskaltrust.Middleware for POSCreators, fiskaltrust offers fee-based add-on products (which are based on the fiskaltrust.Middleware) and individual products (independent of the fiskaltrust.Middleware) for POSOperators. These fiskaltrust products are exclusively distributed to POSOperators by our POSDealer partners as part of their product or service portfolio. These are archiving products, automated reports to the tax office, technical security equipment (TSE) from various manufacturers and also carefree packages with and without TSE-as-a-Service. 

For a current listing of our products, please refer to our [Product Documentation](https://docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/doc/productdescription-de-doc/for-posdealers/01-produkte/README.html).

As part of the rollout, the POSDealer transfers the products previously acquired from fiskaltrust in the form of entitlements to his POSOperators and activates the products per POSOperator outlet. 

In this chapter, we will go into the associated processes and show how they can be carried out by POSDealers with the help of the fiskaltrust.Portal. In addition, we provide you a [german video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6IcV7o_LFM&t=8s) with instructions.

## fiskaltrust.Shop

The purchase of fiskaltrust products takes place via the fiskaltrust.Shop. It is part of the fiskaltrust.Portal. In the "Products" area, suitable fiskaltrust products are offered for purchase depending on the [partner role](../README.md#the-different-roles-of-the-fiskaltrust-partners). For POSDealers, these are, in addition to various TSEs, so-called "Händereinkaufsprodukt", which represent entitlements:

![shop-dealer-products](images/shop-dealer-products.png "Products for POSDealers in shop")



## Framework agreements for volume discount

Before purchasing fiskaltrust products, you as a POSDealer should plan your purchase according to your needs, because fiskaltrust grants volume discounts for quantities of 10 or more. As a POSDealer, please contact our sales team at sales@fiskaltrust.de and agree on the purchase quantity with the help of a framework agreement. You will then receive a volume discount and a credit limit release for the fiskaltrust.Shop, so that you can purchase the desired products there at the price agreed in the framework agreement. 



## Buy products via Entitlements

POSDealers do not buy the fiskaltrust products themselves in the fiskaltrust.Portal, but so-called "Entitlements", claims to the products, which they can then transfer to the POSOperators individually and activate for them per outlet. The entitlements are also listed in the fiskaltrust.Shop under the name "Händereinkaufsprodukt".

In the following example, we show you how you as a POSDealer can purchase entitlements in the fiskaltrust.Shop after signing a framework agreement with corresponding volume discounts and after the credit limit approval. 

In the fiskaltrust.portal, go to the menu item "Shop->Products" and place e.g. 15 pieces of the product "fiskaltrust.Sorglos mit TSE Händlereinkaufsprodukt" (entitlement for a carefree package with TSE-as-a-service) in the shopping cart:

![buy-entitlements-1](images/buy-entitlements-1.png "Add products to chart")



In the top bar you will see a shopping cart icon that you can press. A popup will appear. Select "Checkout" here:

![buy-entitlements-2](images/buy-entitlements-2.png "Checkout")




Next, the summary of your order will be displayed:

![buy-entitlements-3](images/buy-entitlements-3.png "Order is shown")



Check the information and the displayed prices. Then press the button: "Binding order". You will receive a confirmation of your order:

![buy-entitlements-4](images/buy-entitlements-4.png "Order confirmed")

You will also receive a corresponding confirmation of the order by email.

You can also view your orders at any time in the "Shop->Orders" section:

![buy-entitlements-5](images/buy-entitlements-5.png "Order")

You can find the corresponding invoice under "Shop->Invoices".

After the order has been processed by the fiskaltrust system, the Entitlements credited to you will appear in the "Shop->Entitlements" area. In our example, we receive 15 Entitlements for redeeming the Carefree package and 15 Entitlements for redeeming the associated TSE-as-a-Service:

![buy-entitlements-6](images/buy-entitlements-6.png "Entitlements received")

## Transfer of purchased entitlements to the POSOperator

The transfer of the purchased entitlements and the activation of the associated products for the POSOperator is also mapped at fiskaltrust with the help of the shop in the fiskaltrust.portal.

To transfer the previously purchased entitlements to the POSOperator, use the surrogate function in the fiskaltrust.Portal to switch from your account as a POSDealer to the account of the POSOperator. To do this, go to the "POSOperator->Overview" area and search for the POSOperator to whom you want to transfer the entitlement(s):

![search posoperator](images/search-posoperator.png "Search POSOperator")

Now press on the name of the POSOperator, which is displayed in the list as a link (if the name of the POSOperator does not appear here as a link, then he has not yet signed the user agreement). If you click on the link, you will be redirected to the account of the POSOperator. You can recognize this by the fact that a button named "Switch to your account" appears in the upper area on the right and the company name of the POSOperator is now displayed in the menu bar.

![in operator account](images/in-posoperator-account.png "In the account of the POSOperator")

Now go to "Shop->Products" in the menu. Here, first select in the upper area the outlet of the POSOperator to which you want to transfer the entitlements and then put the desired "transfer products" in the shopping cart. In our example: "TSE-as-a-Service - Anspruch übertragen" (transfer claim for a TSE-as-a-Service)  and "fiskaltrust.Sorglos - Anspruch übertragen" (transfer claim for the carefree package):

![transfer claims](images/transfer-claims-1.png "Transfer claims")

Next, add the "activation products" associated with the claims to the shopping cart for activation at the POSOperator. In this example, we now decide to use a Swissbit USB hardware TSE. In our example, the "activation products": "Swissbit USB Hardware TSE-as-a-Service - aus - Anspruch erzeugen" (activate Swissbit USB TSE-as-a-Service by using the entitlement/claim) and "fiskaltrust.Sorglos Betreiber-Abo - aus Anspruch erzeugen" (activate the carefree package by using the entitlement/claim) are to be added to the shopping cart. Note: Please make sure that the correct outlet is selected in the upper area before adding to the shopping cart.

![activate products](images/transfer-claims-2.png "activate products")

If desired, you can repeat the steps described above for other outlets and also for other of your POSOperators and add the claims and activations to the shopping cart for them as well:

1. st step: Select location - in outlet doropdown above.
2. nd step: transfer entitlements/claims - (add to shopping cart)
3. rd step: Activate product in the selected outlet - (add to shopping cart).

The 2nd and 3rd step (activate) always refers to the outlet selected above and can no longer be changed after checkout. If the 3rd step is the activation of a hardware TSE, it will be delivered later to the specified outlet of the POSOperator. However, if you as a POSDealer want the hardware TSE to be sent to your own location, please follow the instructions in the chapter [Delivery options for hardware TSEs](#delivery-options-for-hardware-tses).

Important: To check out the shopping cart, **you must** now return to your POSDealer account. To do this, press the "Switch to your account" button in the upper area on the right:

![back to the posdealer account](images/back-to-posoperator-account.png "Back to the POSDealer account")

Back in your account you can now see that the previously selected products also appear in your shopping cart:

![Checkout in the POSDealer account](images/checkout-in-posoperator-account.png "Checkout in the POSDealer account")

Press "Checkout" here and then check the shopping cart before submitting the order. Above all, check the correctness of the outlet information. These transfers and activations of products for the POSOperator should of course be free of charge.

![Order](images/order-for-operator.png "Order")

Next, you will see the successful order and you will also receive a confirmation email about it. You can view your orders at any time in the "Shop->Orders" area. The corresponding invoices are in the area "Shop->Invoices".

After the order is processed by the fiskaltrust system (can take 2-3 minutes), the used entitlements will be deducted from you. In our example, there are now only 14 left from 15 before.

![claims consumed](images/claims-consumed.png "Claims consumed")

In addition, we can see in the POSOperator's account that the carefree package has been activated for the outlet previously specified during activation:

![carefree activated](images/carefree-activated.png "Product carefree activated")

## Rollout plans

Rollout plans simplify the process described above for acquiring entitlements, transferring them to the POS operators outlets and activating (generating) them for the POS operator. In contrast to the process described above, purchasing plans have the advantage that you do not have to switch to the POSOperator's account to transfer and activate the products. In addition, when you select a purchasing plan, the system automatically selects the required products for you. This reduces the risk of an incorrect composition of the shopping basket.

POSDealers can find this new feature in the fiskaltrust.Portal under the menu item <kbd>Rollout Management</kbd> &rarr; <kbd>Plan</kbd>. 
In our [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzkoaGrQlYk) you will find further explanations.

The process is shown in the following sketch:

![Plan](images/plan.png "Prozess")

### Select a rollout plan

![Plan](images/portal-plans.png "rollout-management  &rarr; plan")

In the fiskaltrust.Portal, select the <kbd>Rollout Management</kbd> menu item and then <kbd>Plan</kbd>.
Reduce the number of plans displayed by setting filter criteria or using the selection bar.
Select one of the plans.

>Note: 
If you want to use the selected plan more often, it is recommended to set a bookmark (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> & <kbd>D</kbd>).

## Select a PosOperator


![Select a PosOperator](images/portal-operators.png "Select a PosOperator")

You can reduce the number of records displayed by setting filter criteria.

Select one of the POSOperators.

### Select outlets


![Select Outlets](images/portal-plan-outlets.png "Select Outlets")

You can reduce the number of records displayed by setting filter criteria.

Select one or more locations (outlets).
Alternatively, use the selection bar and <kbd>Select all</kbd> to select all.
If one or more of the outlets has been selected, <kbd>Nothing selected yet...</kbd> becomes the <kbd>Submit Selection</kbd> button. This will confirm your selection.

>Note: 
>Using <kbd>Clear selection</kbd> will discard your selection of outlets.
>With the back button of the browser you can go back single steps and repeat your selection.

### Rollout summary - creation of a quote

![Create Quote](images/portal-plan-create-quote.png "Create Quote")

Check the details especially the selected plan, POSOperator and outlets.
If desired, you can change the name of the quote.
Confirm your selection with <kbd>Create quote</kbd>. The system will then create a quote or product listing.

>Note: 
If problems occur during the following check of credit limit, number of available Entitlements or similar, you will be informed with an error message.
Make corrections by going back individual steps with the browser's back button and repeating your selections. With <kbd>Search</kbd> you go back to the beginning, to the selection of a plan.

With the button <kbd>Load quote into cart</kbd> you transfer the product listing into the shopping cart.

### Shopping Cart

![Shopping Cart](images/portal_cart.png "Shopping Cart")

You can review your selection here. 
The number of items, detailed descriptions, outlets and the prices are listed. 
On the right, the <kbd>Quote overview</kbd> shows the last purchases made for comparison.  
Confirm your selection with the <kbd>Checkout</kbd> button.

### Binding Order

When ordering, you will receive a summarized overview.
With <kbd>Binding order</kbd> the order is placed.
In the account of the POSOperator, the selected composition can be found within a few minutes.

### Review

You can check the successful completion of the order in the POSOperator's account. To switch to the POSOperator's account, you can use the Surrogate function.

The following image shows an example of the carefree package being activated in the POSOperator's account for the selected location:

![check](images/portal-posoperator-check.png "POSOperator &rarr; Overview")

To use the surrogate function, select in your own account: <kbd>PosOperator</kbd> &rarr; <kbd>Overview</kbd>. 

Find the record of the POS operator you want to check. Press the associated link with the name of the cashier. The system will switch to the account of the cashier.

In the POSOperator's account, now select <kbd>PosOperator's Name</kbd> &rarr; <kbd>Outlets</kbd>.

Filter the locations table by entering a search term or sort the locations by clicking on one of the table headings.

In the <kbd>Carefree</kbd> and <kbd>AKO</kbd> columns, you can check whether these products have been activated.

With <kbd>Switch to your account</kbd> (top right) you get back to your own account as POSDealer.

## Tips & Tricks

1. In addition to the products for transferring and activating the entitlements per POSOperator outlet, you can also add templates for automatic generation of the required CashBoxes (configuration containers) to the POSOperator shopping cart in the same step. This allows you to optimize the rollout process and you do not have to check out the templates separately. You can use your own templates as well as the default templates provided by fiskaltrust. An example of this can be found below in the chapter [Swissbit Cloud TSE checkout and setup](#swissbit-cloud-tse-checkout-and-setup).

2. If desired, you can also purchase the needed "Händlereinkausprodukte", meaning the entitlements, directly in the account of the POSOperators. Meaning that you can put them in the same shopping cart as (see above) their transfer and activation. In this case, you do not need to "transfer" any more, but you will receive a separate invoice for the entitlement. An example of this can be found below in the chapter [Swissbit Cloud TSE checkout and setup](#swissbit-cloud-tse-checkout-and-setup).

Both tips described above are also detailed in our [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6IcV7o_LFM&t=8s).

3. You can save order-templates from orders in the shopping cart to be able to reuse them later. 

## Delivery options for hardware TSEs

As a POSDealer, you can have hardware TSEs delivered either to the POSOperator's outlet or to your own outlet/location. If you follow the process shown in the example above, the activated hardware TSE will be sent to the POSOperator's outlet as selected for activation. 

However, if you want the hardware TSE from the carefree package to be sent to your own outlet instead of the POSOperator's outlet, please activate the hardware TSE from the entitlement/claim in your own account and not in the POSOperator's account.

Referring to the example above, the steps would then be as follows:

Step 1: Go to the fisklatrtust.Shop in your own account and select your own desired outlet in the upper area.

Step 2: In your own account, add the hardware TSE activation product, e.g. the product "Swissbit USB Hardware TSE-as-a-Service - aus Anspruch erzeugen", to the shopping cart - this will ensure that the hardware TSE is sent directly to you.

Step 3: Switch to the account of the POSOperator using the surrogate function (as described above).

Step 4: Go to the fiskaltrust.Shop in the POSOperator's account and select the desired outlet of the POSOperator in the upper area.

Step 5: In the POSOperator's account, transfer the entitlement to the carefree package to the POSOperator, i.e. place the product "fiskaltrust.Sorglos -Anspruch übertragen" in the shopping cart.

Step 6: Activate the carefree package in the account of the POSOperator in the shop, i.e. add the product "fiskaltrust.Sorglos Betreiber-Abo - aus Anspruch erzeugen" to the shopping cart.

Step 7: Switch back to your own account and check out the shopping cart there and place the order.

The difference to the process described in the above chapter is that the entitlement/claim to the hardware TSE is no longer transferred to the POSOperator and activated under his account, but is activated directly in your own account. Thus, the delivery of the hardware TSE from the carefree package is made directly to you as the POSDealer. However, it is important that you continue to transfer the "fiskaltrust.Sorglos" (carefree package) claim to the POSOperator and activate it in the account of the POSOperator for the correct outlet of the POSOperator.


## Swissbit Cloud TSE check out and setup

In this chapter, we would like to use an example to demonstrate how to check out and set up a Swissbit Cloud TSE as part of a Carefree package with TSE-as-a-Service. As an extension to the procedure described above, we will acquire the entitlement for the carefree package ("fiskaltrust.Sorglos mit TSE Händlereinkaufsprodukt") directly in the account of the POSOperator. In addition, for the setup, i.e. for the creation of the cashbox, we will check out the default template provided for the Swissbit Cloud TSE by fiskaltrust in the same shopping cart. These two extensions/optimizations are also described in the chapter [Tips & Tricks](#tips--tricks).

Log in to your POSDealer account and change in the first step with the help of the surrogate function in the account of the POSOperator. To do this, search under the menu item "POSOperator->Overview" for the POSOperator for which you want to check out and set up the Swissbit Cloud TSE:

![Search POSOperator](images/search-posoperator.png "Search POSOperator")

Now press on the name of the POSOperator, which is displayed in the list as a link (if the name of the POSOperator does not appear here as a link, then he has not yet signed the user agreement). This will redirect you to the POSOperator's account. You can recognize this by the fact that a button named "Switch to your account" appears in the upper area on the right and the company name of the POSOperator is now displayed in the menu bar.

![In the account of the PosOperator](images/in-posoperator-account.png "In the account of the PosOperator")

Now press the menu item: "Shop->Products" in the account of the POSOperator. First select the desired outlet of the POSOperator in the upper area.

![swissbit cloud products](images/swissbit-cloud-1.png "Swissbit Cloud TSE products")

Next, add the following products to your shopping cart:

- fiskaltrust.Sorglos mit TSE Händlereinkaufsprodukt
- Swissbit Cloud TSE-as-a-Service - aus - Anspruch erzeugen
- fiskaltrust.Sorglos Betreiber-Abo - aus Anspruch erzeugen
- fiskaltrust.Middleware mit Swissbit Cloud TSE (this is the fiskaltrust template to create the CashBox).

Important: To check out the shopping cart, **you must** now return to your POSDealer account. To do this, press the "Switch to your account" button in the upper area on the right:

![Back to the POSDealer account](images/back-to-posoperator-account.png "Back to the POSDealer account")



Back in your account, you can now see that the previously selected products also appear in your shopping cart:

![swissbit cloud checkout](images/swissbit-cloud-2.png "Swissbit Cloud TSE Checkout")

Press "Checkout" here and then check the shopping cart before submitting the order. Especially check the correctness of the outlet information.

![swissbit cloud check](images/swissbit-cloud-3.png "Swissbit Cloud TSE check")

Next, you will see the successful order and you will also receive a confirmation email about it. You can view your orders at any time in the "Shop->Orders" area. The corresponding invoices are in the area "Shop->Invoices".

After the order has been processed by the fiskaltrust system (can take 2-3 minutes), you can see in the POSOperator's account that the previously ordered carefree package has been activated in the POSOperator's outlet. To do this, use the surrogation function to switch to the POSOperator's account and go to "[Company name] -> Outlets" in the menu:

![carefee aktiv](images/swissbit-cloud-4.png "Carefree activated")

In addition, the CashBox was also created because before that we added the template to the cart and checked out. To check this, go to "Configuration -> CashBox" in the menu:

![cashbox created](images/swissbit-cloud-5.png "Cashbox created")

This sets up the CashBox for the Swissbit Cloud TSE. You can now download and start the desired launcher, it uses the previously created CashBox for the Swissbit Cloud TSE for configuration.

Please also refer to the document [Technical specials of the Swissbit Cloud](swissbit-cloud-special.md)

## Fiskaly Cloud TSE check out and setup

The process for checking out and setting up a Fiskaly Cloud TSE is analogous to the process described above in chapter [Swissbit Cloud TSE check out and set up](#swissbit-cloud-tse-check-out-and-setup). The only difference is that here you obtain and set up the Fiskaly Cloud TSE instead of the Swissbit Cloud TSE. To do this, place the product "Fisklay Cloud TSE-as-a-Service - aus - Anspruch erzeugen" in the shopping cart instead of the product "Swissbit Cloud TSE-as-a-Service - aus - Anspruch erzeugen". Also, instead of the template product "fiskaltrust.Middleware mit Swissbit Cloud TSE", put the template product "fiskaltrust.Middleware mit Fiskaly Cloud TSE" in the shopping cart. Otherwise, the procedure is identical to the one described above for the Swissbit Cloud TSE.
