:::



## Introduction

*fiskaltrust* offers an end-to-end solution for your POS System to ensure it issues receipts in a legal and fiscally compliant way. The portfolio comprises a comprehensive stack of software and services around **fiscal compliance**** and provides a **unified approach** across countries and markets.

The core components are the Middleware for **signing and tracking receipts** and the portal for **managing the service**. Additionally, a range of supporting services, third-party interfaces, and [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) subscriptions are offered. 

The following paragraphs will provide you with a brief overview on these topics.


## Middleware

The Middleware is a **multi-platform** software solution that complements your POS System and provides the core service of **signing POS receipts** using the relevant and required national signing mechanisms. The fiskaltrust.Middleware also **keeps track of receipts in a secure and auditable fashion** and ensures its relevant portal information is kept up to date.

The fiskaltrust.Middleware is one of the centerpieces of the *fiskaltrust* stack and is available for all supported countries. It provides a **single, standardized, and unified** communication interface, which significantly simplifies rollouts in new markets.

The fiskaltrust.Middleware features a **REST interface** for communication with your POS Systems. It is available for **on-premise** deployment on platforms supporting **.NET** and **Android** and an **off-premise** SaaS solution. For the latter, please see [Hosted Middleware](#hosted-middleware) for further details.

## Portal

The fiskaltrust.Portal is your central management tool for the entire *fiskaltrust* stack. It is a web-based platform and allows you to e.g. manage your account, configure your Middleware instances, download deployment packages, and access and process your business data.

## Revision-Safe Receipt Archive

The _archive service_ is an optional and chargeable add-on product. It enables your middleware instance to use archive functions. After activating an archive service, the middleware saves new receipts in the archive, which persists them in a **secure** and **tamper-proof** receipt chain.  
The receipt chain can be **retrieved and exported at any time** via the portal (e.g. for a tax audit) and stored as **long as national regulations require**.

### Exports & third-party Interfaces

An active _archive service_ package will allow you to export your data using the portal in various **formats** relevant to the applicable national regulations.

In addition to manual exports, the fiskaltrust.Portal supports the integration of third-party services. This integration transparently allows data to be replicated from *fiskaltrust* accounts to accounts at other service providers. The availability of third-party services depends on your country and may require additional service subscriptions.

## Hosted Middleware

In some countries, *fiskaltrust* offers a [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) version of the Middleware, allowing your POS System to sign and manage receipts **without **the need of installing** and maintaining additional software**. In this case, your POS System will connect to the *fiskaltrust*-hosted Middleware via an encrypted, **HTTPS-secured** Internet connection. These setups are managed exclusively via the fiskaltrust.Portal.

## Signing

Where applicable, *fiskaltrust* offers dedicated **signing services** as backend for the Middleware, providing the required receipt signature data blocks according to the relevant national regulations. These are subscription-based services which, typically, come in the form of leased hardware dongles ([SSCDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_signature_creation_device)) or access to SaaS platforms.
