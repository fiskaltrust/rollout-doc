The following paragraphs will briefly overview the general actions and tasks you can perform in the portal.

:::tip surrogating

Please pay particular attention to the [surrogating](#surrogating) feature, which enables you - as a PosDealer - to perform many steps for associated PosOperators.

:::

## Account Management

In the *Company* section, you select first from the appropriate **Roles** (_PosCreator_, _PosDealer_, or _PosOperator_) and sign the **Contractual Agreements** for your company. Then you have to check the master data for completeness and, especially the business data, for validity. The next step is to add your company's **outlets** with their configurations in this section. You also can configure accounts for your **employees** and manage their permissions.  
The section for the *user* account allows you to manage user data, like **contact and address details**, username and password.  

## Operator Management

The *PosOperator* section is where you **invite** your customers to *fiskaltrust* and manage their accounts. Having accepted your invitation and signed a **Contract** for a role as PosOperator, their **account will be associated** with yours, which will make [surrogating](#surrogating) possible.


## Surrogating

You, as a PosDealer can switch into the account of your PosOperators. Depending on permissions, you may use **read-only** access, **write** access, or have the authority to sign contracts on behalf of your PosOperators. For *PosDealers*, this is an **essential benefit** of the *fiskaltrust.Portal* for establishing and expanding business collaboration.

More information is available in the chapter [Surrogating](../getting-started/operator-onboarding/surrogating.md).

## Data Management

 The *fiskaltrust.Portal* allows you to **export your data** by various selection criteria and in **different export formats**. Depending on their availability, it is also possible to configure data replication to **third-party service providers**.

## CashBox Maintenance

The *Configuration* section in the portal is the starting point for any *fiskaltrust.CashBox*. In this section, you first create and configure the individual **CashBox components** (queue, SCU) and **assemble** these into your final CashBox setup. Then, having finalized your CashBox, you can download **deployment packages** for several different target systems.

## Shop

The shop is another crucial feature of the *fiskaltrust.Portal* and provides access to all additional **add-on products and services** offered by *fiskaltrust*. For example, various product bundles, hardware solutions, archives and other services. Items can be purchased either individually or as part of pre-configured **rollout plans**.
