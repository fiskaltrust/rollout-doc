# Introduction
We created this documentation for cash register dealers (_PosDealers_). It describes the steps recommended by fiskaltrust for the successful purchase, resale, rollout and support of our products.

## Sections of this documentation

You, as a PosDealer, can learn more about our business fundamentals in the **Business Basics** section or look them up later. There, you will also find details about the fiskaltrust.Portal, the countries where we offer our services and their Fair Use Policies.

Before rolling out a POS System at a customer site, you need a playground to thoroughly test the services and products. At **Getting Started**, we explain the concept of our _Sandbox_. _Registration_ and use are free of charge. After that, you will get familiar with _Company Roles_ and _Operator Onboarding_ and follow _My First Cashbox_ to create your first demo setup.

With **Buy/Resell**, you can expand your knowledge of our business model. You will learn how to make a _Volume purchase agreement_ for which _Products_. With _Rollout Management_, rollouts at the PosOperator succeed in a standardized manner and with the _Shop_ in a highly individualized way.  

In the **Technical Operations** section, you will find _Scenarios_ for using our products for different requirements. Also, in-depth details on _Middleware_ and _Rollout Automation_ avoid time-consuming problems with _Troubleshooting_ or _Maintenance_.

_fiskaltrust_ provides you as PosDealer with **Information sources**. On the one hand, you will find the _Knowledge Base_ in the fiskaltrust.Portal,
possible _Cases_ at our support, contractual information and various exports for download. On the other hand, efficiently using this _documentation_, read our _News_ and learn more about other information sources such as _Webinars_ and _Videos_. If _Contacting support_ should be necessary, we will help you prepare your request to best support the process.

If you are still getting familiar with the used expressions or want to reassure your understanding of our usage of them, look at the [Terminology](https://docs.fiskaltrust.cloud/de/docs/faq/terms).

## Target audience
We created this documentation for all employees of PosDealers that are involved in working with fiskaltrust's products. While most of the information published here is technical- or business-driven, distinctive sections may be relevant for other target audiences like members of legal departments.
